## Purpose & Scope
Snooze It is an application that allows users to store a range of sleep information. This will save a user's sleeping hours on a daily basis, quality of sleep in accordance with other factors contributing to quality of sleep. The application will also allow users to view a summary of their sleep information over periods of a week, a month and 3 months.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my current skills and ability in a range of developer tools encompassing the python programming language. 
This project will also stretch my ability to design, implement and test an application, where in this project it will be creating a terminal (command line) application. 

## Target Audience
The application is targeted for users of any age and gender who is able to run the application using the help documentation below on their computer terminal and log in inputs are welcome to utilise the application. 

## Features

### 1. Utilise an Account
The application allows users to register for an account and save their sleep information. 
Existing users can also log in using their credentials to access their personal information.  

### 1. Log Daily Sleep Times & factors contributing to Sleep
Users are able to log in sleep time every day and keep track of the quality of their sleep, whether they had a goodnight's sleep or they didn't, rating it from 1-10.
The application allows users to write down comments and factors during the day or during the night before they slept that could impact the user's sleep.

### 2. Sleep Reports
Gives user reports of their sleep time, quality and other factors or comments associated with that sleep within certain time perioeds. I have filtered them to 1 week, 1 month and 3 months.

### 3. Suggest Tips on better Sleep
Gives users useful tips to help them gain ample quantity and quality sleep for a more productive day 

## Implementation Plan

To implement the development steps of my application, I utilised Trello to keep note of all of my progress, the different features of my application and the to-do list for every feature to be completed. I listed every task that was required to do for each feature, categorised them accordingly and gave each task a deadline date to complete the task by.  

Every time a task is completed, the date deadline box can be clicked to give a green box with a tick, which marks the task as completed on trello.
